About
-----

"Hello, world!" applications don't get the respect they deserve.  As the humble
beginnings of literaly every software project that's ever existed, they deserve
to be revered and expanded upon.

Enter Hello World Helicopter.  A small step towards achieving this modest goal.
Now you can relive your first coding adventures and your favorite browser game,
from back when flash was king.

Good luck on your adventure through the never-ending\* depths of your text based
cave.
